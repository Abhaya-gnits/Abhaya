# Abhaya
- ABHAYA, is the women safety club of GNITS that came into limelight in the year of 2020 with an aim of creating a safe environment for women, empowering them and enabling them to raise their opinions.This club is an initiative taken by Mrs.T.Aparna mam, students of GNITS in colloboration with TS Police.
Since the establishment of ABHAYA we have conducted several events, seminars and self-defense training for women to publicize the club and it's ideas. We started entering into all the possible social handles for staying  well-connected with women who need's our help. Most of the ABHAYA memebers are well trained to reach out to people and help them. We also dealt with a couple of cases out of campus who pinged us through our instagram handle. This webpage is also built to get much closer to you. 
- With this web page as an interface, we would like to thank everyone for being so positive towards ABHAYA and we promise to help all the women out there who's in need.
But remember," Everything depends on you perspective"," Don't magnify your issues, whatever it is. Remember, you have your parents, well-wishers and ABHAYA to save you when in need.
